    <h2 id="rails">Creator of Ruby on Rails</h2>
    <p><a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and beautiful code. I created Rails in 2003 by extracting it from <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> and continue to lead the development.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of thousands of programmers around the world have built amazing applications using Rails. Some of the more famous include <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://squareup.com">Square</a>, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net">Artsy</a>, <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>.

    <h2 id="basecamp">Cofounder & CTO at Basecamp</h2>
    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> is the saner, organized way to manage projects and communicate company-wide. It's software as a service and we've been around for about fifteen years. I run the company together with my business partner, Jason Fried, and <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/team">our lovely team</a> of some fifty programmers, designers, supporters, and sysops.</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 10px"><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm/">It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work</a> is my latest book written together with Jason. It's about how to run a calm company by forgoing the lure of excessive growth and making your time count for more.</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 10px"><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework/">REWORK</a> is a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Sunday Times best seller with more than half a million copies sold around the world. It's a book about starting and running businesses a better way.</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 10px"><a href="https://basecamp.com/books/remote/">REMOTE: Office Not Required</a> encapsulates all I've learned about working remotely for the past decade. It includes all the arguments for why the time is right for remote work to blossom, and for how you can navigate the pitfalls.</p>

    <hr style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid silver;">

    <p style="padding-top: 10px">Finally, <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real/">Getting Real</a> was the first book I wrote together with Jason. It shares everything we learned building Basecamp and a web-app software business. It may be over a decade old, but it's still on point.</p>

    <p>I've also been <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/author/dhh/">writing on the blog Signal v Noise</a> for the past two decades. Here are some you might like: <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider/">RECONSIDER</a>, about the Unicorn-hysteria in the startup world, and <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-day-i-became-a-millionaire/">The day I became a millionaire</a>, about, well, becoming a millionaire!</p>

    <h2 id="driver">Le Mans & WEC class-winning racing driver</h2>
    <p>I've raced in the FIA <a href="https://www.fiawec.com">World Endurance Championship</a> for the past seven years. In 2014, I won my class in the 82nd running of the 24 hours of Le Mans â€“ the world's biggest endurance race. I also won the WEC championship in the GTE-Am category that year.</p>

    <h2 id="podcasts">Podcast guest</h2>
